# SafaiCorpSoftware
Welcome to the SafaiCorp TM software devolpment team! We seek to make space a more efficient, automated, and overly engineered place! 

It is our strong opnion that the best way to play space engineers is to not actually play space engineers! Instead we make machines
that play it for us and then watch them go!

BASE.CS containes the method signitures that the Programmable blocks will call and is a good place to copy and paste from for new files.

Best refernce around -> https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/wiki/Namespace-Index OR just check the actual game code repo (All the API's 
are defined in the InGame folder)

If you add a new broadcast tag PLEASE add it to the channels.txt file!

Happy Coding!
