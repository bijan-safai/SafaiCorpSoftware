THE SAFAICORP SPACE SAT COMM PROTOCOL 

            AKA
        
           SAFNET

This document defines the communication protocol used by SafaiCorp assets to commuicate through SafaiCorp communication satellites.

Note: "satellite" is a generic term here, safnet can be used to as a router for any kind of Grid Communication

This doc assumes the reader understands the diffrence between unicast and broadcast. A short explenation will be given here.

In short Unicast messages send a message to a recivier with a specific UnicastId (think address or ip address) where as Broadcast messages are sent to all blocks
in the broadcast range which are lisiting to the tag the broadcast message is tagged with (think radio frequency or tv chanels). These are space egineers api concepts and exsist underneath safnet.

The messages sent by Unicast and BroadCast are the same. They contain a string tag, and then some kind of data. This data can be any object.


-----------------------SafNet Definition------------------------


Assets may communicate with satellites in two ways:
    1. Broadcast messages to aquire the comm satellites unicast address
    2. Unicast messages to a specific satellite.
Both protocols will be defined in full now.

1. Broadcast messages // TODO change broadcast response to unicast response, no reason to blast the sat name all over the galaxy

    Broadcast messages will ONLY be used to aquire ComSats unicast Ids. This can be done in two ways.
    If you know the name of the satellite whos Id you want then simply broadcast a message with the tag:
        Aquire_{SatNameHere}_UnicastId
    And listen for the tag:
        Provide_{SatName}_UnicastId
    The unicast id will be transmmited in the data of the message.

    If you are trying to communicate with any satellite and wish to aquire the addresses of all satellites which you
    are capable of communicating with then broadcast with the tag:
        Aquire_All_CommSat_UnicastId
    And listen for the tag:
        Provide_All_CommSat_UnicastId
    The data of the message will be formated as : {SatName}/{UnicastId}

    ALL OTHER COMMUINCATION MUST BE DONE THROUGH UNICAST, COMSATS LISTEN TO NO OTHER TAGS
    Note: As multiplayer becomes a thing we may want to add some kind of auth layer

2. Unicast messages

    The handeling of unicast messages will always be detirmened by the tag of the message.
    Tags will esseintaly serve as serialized instuction sets, and will be read from left to right.
    Individal tag elements will be deliminiated by the '/' char. This char is reserved and CANNOT be used anywhere else in the tag.
    The leftmost tag element will be referred to as the top level tag, all others will be referred to as subtags.
    There are three allowed top level tags:
        Pass        // for pass through
        Script      // for sat specific script execution
        Ping        // basic ping
    
    Ping : 
    
    The Ping tag takes no other subtags. It will simply respond to the caller with the tag "Ping/{SatName}" and the version of SafNet being used in the data of the message as a string. This will be a 
    unicast response.
    
    Script:

    The script tag will allow specific satellites to handle lightweight subrutines which requre communication. The format is defined as
        Script/{script name}/{args}
    The satellite will pass the args direcly to the script, so the format is up to the implementation but the '/' char CANNOT be used in the args.
    Scripts should only be executed on the satellite if they require communication with a large number of assets, and should be limited to data collection
    and aggragation. Any more complex logic should be offloaded to the calling block.

    Pass:

    The Pass tag allows the sat to pass messages through to assets not capable of communicating whith eachother directly. It has two second level subtags, 
    corrisponding to the two possible modes of transmmiting messages, Unicast and Broadcast. These tags will be referred to as the ComMethod tags
        Uni
        Broad
    The subtags of the two differ slightly. Broadcasts require only a tag for communication, however unicasts require a specific address, therefore, immidetly 
    following a Uni tag the address must be provided as a subtag. This address tag is considerd an element of the ComMethod tag. Other then that the tag structure is identical.

    After the ComMethod tag(s) there is one more required tag. The actual tag to be passed through to the callee. This tag can take any form but CANNOT contain the '/' char.
    
    Below are the two formats of the Pass tag:

    Pass/Uni/{UnicastId}/{Tag}
    Pass/Broad/{Tag}

    If the tag is properly parsed then it will be used to pass through whatever is in the data of the message to the callee as a string.

    One final note on the pass through protocol. Much like HTTPS the pass through protocol is completly agnostic to the API's which commuicate through it. 
    HOWEVER 
    !!!!!!!! ALL DATA IS SENT AS A STRING SO BE READY TO PARSE IT ON THE OTHER SIDE !!!!!!!!!

ERROR handeling
    In the event of an invalid message or general execution error, the caller will be sent a unicast message with a tag formatted as
    "{SatName}/Error"
    and an error message in the Data portion as a string.

Possible improvments:
    If we can ever think of a reason to use a specific broadcast range the maybe we embed that as a final optional tag.
    It would be great if we didnt have to send everything as strings and pass generic objects around.
    We should add basic auth for multiplayer. It doesent have to be great and if someone takes the time to crack it then GOOD FOR THEM ITS A FUCKING GAME THEY CAN FUCK WITH OUR NETWORK.
